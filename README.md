#Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the Senior Research project of Tamara Dzolic for Data Analytics Senior Capstone. This project aimed to look at the relatioship between Political polarization and the quality of rights and equality women have in each state. Here you will find all my files and data used in the project. Datasets used in my analysis are titled "StatTable1.csv", "stateideology_v2018.csv" and "Average_Ideologies.csv".
